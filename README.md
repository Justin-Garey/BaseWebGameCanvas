# Base Web Game Canvas

This repository is for quickly starting and working on a web based game using HTML Canvas. The base uses the Vite build tool, the React library, and TypeScript for type safety. Vite and React are meant to provide a minimal structure for the web game while having the ability to be expanded into a larger website. The setup is also useful if the game is going to be added into an existing React project as it can sometimes be a little confusing to port a game to a React environment.

## Project Creation

The project was created using [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/):
```bash
npm create vite@latest base-game-canvas-ts -- --template react-ts
```
